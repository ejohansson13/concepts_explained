# Concepts Explained

This repository contains links to various machine learning technologies. Each repository will contain an explanation of the machine learning concept or architecture, code to build the model architecture from scratch, and an examples page illustrating the model deployment. The repositories will aim to explain concepts from two perspectives: one without any assumption of prior machine learning experience and one with an assumption of some machine learning familiarity. The explanations without an assumption of an ML background aim to be comprehensive and build conceptual ideas from scratch. Explaining these concepts from the ground level takes some time and, unfortunately, are often the last pieces of the repositories to be published. If you visit any of these repositores and they are missing the baseline exception, they should soon be updated. Here are the repositories currently available:

**U-Net** -  https://github.com/ejohansson13/UNet

**Latent Diffusion Models** - https://github.com/ejohansson13/Latent-Diffusion

All links from this repo focus on ML technology, and a fair assumption would be their content is partially or entirely generated with the help of artificial intelligence. They are not. These repositories are an opportunity for me to explain these concepts and in the process, consolidate my understanding. They are also an opportunity to practice written communication and expressing ideas in a concise format. Both of these objectives would be diminished if an LLM were generating each token instead. Generative AI will not be employed in any of these repositories beyond where explicitly mentioned, e.g., demonstrating image generation in the Latent Diffusion Models repository.
