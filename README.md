# Concepts Explained
Hello! And welcome to concepts explained. In this repository, I'll be covering an abundance of machine learning technology and architectures that I've come across in the development of personal projects. Starting off, these will be technologies I'm already familiar with, but I'm hoping this grows into a community where I can teach these concepts as I learn them. This space will be an opportunity for me to consolidate these ideas and express them in an intuitive and concise manner. It will also be an opportunity for you to learn these technologies as well! I won't make any assumptions about anyone's background in machine learning, computer science, or even mathematics. Hopefully, these explanations will be thorough enough that anyone with any background could come across this repository and learn all about Stable Diffusion, Automated Speech Recognition models, or any other cutting-edge deep learning technology we cover. For that reason, if you are someone with a background in machine learning, a lot of these explanations may feel rudimentary to you. Feel free to skip ahead and only cover the information that helps in your learning. That's about it, have a great day and COYG!
