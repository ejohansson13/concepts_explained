# Concepts Explained
Welcome to concepts explained!! In this repository, I'll be covering machine learning technology and architectures I come across in the development of personal projects. There's a common train of thought that if you can't explain a specialized concept to an individual outside your specialized field, you don't truly understand said concept. This space offers me an opportunity to explain all kinds of specialized machine learning concepts to those outside of machine learning. Every folder will have two Markdown (.md) files relevant to that folder's core concept: one intended for those with a background in machine learning and one intended to be understood by anyone and everyone without a machine learning background. The latter is intended to convey as much information as the former, but might necessarily abstract some details to paint a picture of the technology while remaining digestible. No matter what your background, I hope this repository helps your understanding of these ideas.

Every Markdown file corresponding to concept X intended for those with a background in machine learning will be titled X_ML.md. Alternatively, explanation files corresponding to the same idea written for those without a background in machine learning will be titled X.md. As these are intended for readers from all backgrounds, I'll try to refrain from any jargon, but if you find yourself wondering about specific terminology, I've created the terminology.md file in the home directory. In this file, you'll find more information on the acronyms and definitions I apply throughout this repository's explanations.

Enjoy!!
