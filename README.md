# Concepts Explained
Hello! And welcome to concepts explained. In this repository, I'll be covering an abundance of machine learning technology and architectures that I've come across in the development of personal projects. This space will be an opportunity for me to consolidate these ideas and express them in an intuitive and concise manner. It will also be an opportunity for anyone and everyone to learn them as well! I won't make any assumptions about anyone's background in machine learning, computer science, or even mathematics. Hopefully, these explanations will be thorough enough that anyone with any background can come across this repository and learn all about Latent Diffusion, Automated Speech Recognition models, or any other deep learning technology we cover. For that reason, if you are someone with a background in machine learning, a lot of these explanations may feel rudimentary to you. Feel free to skip ahead and only cover the information that helps in your learning. Hope this helps, and enjoy!!
