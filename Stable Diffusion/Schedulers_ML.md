# Schedulers

This page is intended to cover schedulers and the more popular scheduling algorithms utilized in Latent Diffusion Models. This is intended to be a summary overview, and will focus on broad comparison between algorithms. If you are looking for a detailed examination of theoretical intricacies within these differential equations, I would suggest looking elsewhere. In this page we will abstract these details, and observe schedulers through the lens of their serviceability as noise schedulers for latent diffusion models.

## DDPM

Every scheduling algorithm we will look at today was derived from the original [DDPM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239), which examined diffusion models as Markov chains with Gaussian elements. When training, the paper optimized across the variational bound of the negative log likelihood. The reordering of the negative log likelihood provided the below equation.

The above equation contains comparisons between Gaussians via [KL divergences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence). The authors recognized that this could be resolved with with [Rao-Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao%E2%80%93Blackwell_theorem) methodologies rather than [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) estimates. The benefit of Rao-Blackwell equations is their transformation of equations into estimators that can be optimized through mean-squared-error criteria, a common quality metric within machine learning. Monte Carlo estimates, in contrast, depend on repeated random sampling for coherent numerical results. By treating the negative log likelihood as a summation of Rao-Blackwell equations, each term within the log likelihood could be optimized with respect to mean-squared-error. Tying the L<sub>T</sub> term to constants allowed the term's treatment as a constant during training. The great insight of the paper came from viewing L<sub>t-1</sub> as "equal to (one term of) the variational bound for the Langevin-like reverse process". This broadened the microscope on diffusion model equations and recognized them as parallel to differential equations for nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Researchers could approximate denoising score matching as a sampling chain with [Langevin-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langevin_dynamics) dynamics. All of which is a lot of words to say, they recognized that inference of diffusion models beared a lot of resemblance to other stochastic differential equations used for modeling molecular systems' dynamics. Tricks used in simplifying thermodynamic differential equations could be borrowed for diffusion models, a conclusion that influenced subsequent scheduling algorithms and accelerated the success of diffusion models for image generation tasks.

Some other important insights from the DDPM paper include the highlighting of semantic vs perceptual compression, a phenomenon referred to in previous literature as conceptual compression. The below graphs may look familiar. The original (left), taken from the DDPM paper, highlighted the rate-distortion tradeoff when training on the CIFAR-10 test set, with the majority of bits exhausted on imperceptible distortions. It was also used in the [Latent Diffusion Models paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752.pdf) (right) to emphasize the almost segmented learning process of image synthesis models, supporting the utilization of autoencoders in concert with diffusion models. Additionally, the authors' progressive lossy decompression scheme was considered a generalized application of autoregressive decoding, which ultimately became a key component of the [original Dall-E](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12092.pdf) and [Parti](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10789.pdf) research papers.

Unfortunately, like all novel discoveries, it came with flaws. DDPMs relied on an impractically large number of inference steps, with the paper only demonstrating satisfactory image quality and diversity after about 1000 steps. These steps followed the reversal of the diffusion process and were required to be performed sequentially, negating the computational power of GPUs in performing operations in parallel. Lastly, the model was unable to encode samples from the latent space for a visualization of the generation process due to the stochastic sampling of its diffusion process.

Also not deterministic because of stochasticity. Interpolate near image space due to stochastic generative process. Latent variables are relatively high dimensional.
