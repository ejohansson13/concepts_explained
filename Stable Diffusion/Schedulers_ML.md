# Schedulers

This page is intended to cover schedulers and the more popular scheduling algorithms utilized in Latent Diffusion Models. This is intended to be a summary overview, and will focus on broad comparison between algorithms. If you are looking for a detailed examination of theoretical intricacies within these differential equations, I would suggest looking elsewhere. In this page we will abstract these details, and observe schedulers through the lens of their serviceability as noise schedulers for latent diffusion models.

All quotes, ideas, and images from the summarization of each research paper are taken from the accompanying paper unless cited otherwise.

## DDPM

Every scheduling algorithm we will look at today was derived from the original [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239), which examined diffusion models as Markov chains with Gaussian elements. When training, the paper optimized across the variational bound of the negative log likelihood. The reordering of the negative log likelihood provided the below equation.

The equation contains comparisons between Gaussians via [KL divergences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence). The authors recognized that this could be resolved with a [Rao-Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao%E2%80%93Blackwell_theorem) approach rather than [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) estimates. The benefit of Rao-Blackwell equations is their transformation of equations into estimators that can be optimized through mean-squared-error criteria, a common quality metric within machine learning. Monte Carlo estimates, in contrast, depend on repeated random sampling for coherent numerical results. By treating the negative log likelihood as a summation of Rao-Blackwell equations, each term within the log likelihood could be optimized with respect to mean-squared-error. Tying the L<sub>T</sub> term to constants allowed the term's treatment as a constant during training. The great insight of the paper came from viewing L<sub>t-1</sub> as "equal to (one term of) the variational bound for the Langevin-like reverse process". This broadened the microscope on diffusion model equations and recognized them as parallel to differential equations for nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Researchers could approximate denoising score matching as a sampling chain with [Langevin-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langevin_dynamics) dynamics. All of which is a lot of words to say, they recognized that inference of diffusion models beared a lot of resemblance to other stochastic differential equations used for modeling molecular systems' dynamics. Tricks used in simplifying thermodynamic differential equations could be borrowed for diffusion models, a conclusion that influenced subsequent scheduling algorithms and accelerated the success of diffusion models for image generation tasks.

Some other important insights from the DDPM paper include the highlighting of semantic vs perceptual compression, a phenomenon referred to in previous literature as conceptual compression. The below graphs may look familiar. The original (left), taken from the DDPM paper, highlighted the rate-distortion tradeoff when training on the CIFAR-10 test set, with the majority of bits exhausted on imperceptible distortions. It was also used in the [Latent Diffusion Models paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752.pdf) (right) to emphasize the almost segmented learning process of image synthesis models, supporting the utilization of autoencoders in concert with diffusion models. Additionally, the authors' progressive lossy decompression scheme was considered a generalized application of autoregressive decoding, which ultimately became a key component of the [original Dall-E](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12092.pdf) and [Parti](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10789.pdf) research papers.

Unfortunately, like all novel discoveries, DDPMs came with flaws. They relied on an impractically large number of inference steps, with the paper only demonstrating satisfactory image quality and diversity after about 1000 steps. These steps followed the reversal of the diffusion process and were required to be performed sequentially, negating the computational power of GPUs in performing operations in parallel. DDPMs lacked control, as the model was entirely predicated on stochastic generation. Images would likely follow themes of their training data, but researchers had no further control over the generation process. The same latent noise variable could be denoised to a variety of results resembling the training images. These latent variables were also relatively high dimensional, forcing image interpolation near pixel-space and greatly increasing compute costs.

## DDIM

[Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502?ref=blog.segmind.com) were directly inspired by DDPMs. Their main goal was to achieve a faster inference time than DDPMs without sacrificing sample quality, proving that diffusion models could be competitive with GANs and other image generation architectures. Their key insight was examining non-Markovian inference processes with an equivalent surrogate objective function to DDPMs. DDPMs depended on a Markov-like chain of denoising to reverse the addition of noise to an image. To prevent this sequential dependence on the previous step for inference, researchers posited a non-Markovian generation process for decreased latency. Below, the left side of the image represents a Markov chain for denoising used in the DDPM paper. The right side of the image contains a graphical illustration of the DDIM process, where the progressive denoising of an image is not wholly dependent on the previous stage.

Researchers observed that the DDPM objective focused on the marginal probability of a noisy image given the denoised image, and not on the joint probability distribution of all images in the denoising process. However, multiple joint probability distributions exist with equivalent marginals to the DDPM objective. This takeaway expanded the possible generative processes that could be implemented. Authors of the DDPM paper had already leveraged the Gaussian nature of the added noise probability distribution to minimize the KL-divergence between the added noise probability distribution and the denoising distribution. By fixing the variance of these distributions, they had expressed a relationship between the means of each distribution such that each addition of noise to the image was solely dependent on the previous image's level of noise. This made reversing the noise process simplistic, albeit slow. The DDIM paper actually expanded the additive noise process and introduced a vector sigma. Regardless of the value of sigma, the training objective remains the same across the family of distributions. In fact, the same substitution utilized in the DDPM paper for sampling can be employed here to give a new sampling equation for denoising images. The vector sigma controls the stochasticity of the inference process. Below, you can see the new additive noise distribution and the accompanying sampling equation for denoising[1].

The new family of generative processes include the DDPM process as a special case. With sigma set to $`\sqrt{(1-α_{t-1}) / (1-α_{t})} \sqrt{1-(α_t / α_{t-1})}`$ for all t, researchers arrive at the DDPM process. With sigma set to 0, researchers arrived at an entirely deterministic image generation process. Previous image generation models often illustrated to their hearts' content with no guarantee of image replicability. DDIMs offered consistency. Images synthesized from the same latent variable would inevitably share high-level features. This replicability in the latent space also lended itself to image interpolation. Linear combinations of latent variables would lead to a blend of each image concept in the final output. DDIMs offered multiple improvements over DDPMs, but the authors' main intention was to arrive at an algorithm with faster inference speed. They previously noted that marginal distribution of noise was the priority in denoising an image. This observation was again useful in deciding that for as long as the marginal was fixed, the forward procedure was not tied to any level of specificity. Rather than iterating over every possible stage in the denoising sequence, researchers chose to jump subsets of the latent variables while maintaing the marginal distribution. A model trained with a requisite 1000 forward steps could now be sampled with a subset of 20 steps at a time. This smaller sampling trajectory would lead to only 50 necessary iterations along the generative process, but still maintain the same objective function and ultimate destination, as the previous model that would have taken 1000 steps to arrive. A graphical concept of this illustration is provided below.

Researchers also observed that there was still a general trend between inference speed and quality. The larger number of inference steps allowed for a generated image tended to correlate to the quality of that image. This allowed for a tradeoff between inference speed and image quality, granting greater customization and flexibility for implementation. Figure out how to conenct to separation of algorithm from model and put a bow on conclusion.

Allowed for separation of scheduling algorithm from model architecture. "From the definition of Jσ, it would appear that a different model has to be trained for every choice of σ, since it corresponds to a different variational objective (and a different generative process). However, Jσ is equivalent to Lγ for certain weights γ, as we show below... With L1 as the objective, we are not only learning a generative process for the Markovian inference process considered in Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015) and Ho et al. (2020), but also generative processes for many non-Markovian forward processes parametrized by σ that we have described. Therefore, we can essentially use pretrained DDPM models as the solutions to the new objectives, and focus on finding a generative process that is better at producing samples subject to our needs by changing σ."

## Euler

If DDIMs laxly negotiated the loosening of constraints accompanying the DDPM theory, [Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364?ref=blog.segmind.com) arrived with a bang and a demand for further liberation from said constraints. The first sentence announced the authors' intent: "We argue that the theory and practice of diffusion-based generative models are currently unnecessarily convoluted and seek to remedy the situation by presenting a design space that clearly separates the concrete design choices". They succeeded. Over a third of the schedulers currently available (as of January 2024) on Hugging Face for Stable Diffusion implementation owe their theoretical background to this literature[2]. Unlike the other schedulers covered so far, I'll also be heavily borrowing concepts and ideas from the accompanying video presentation of their research paper[3]. If you haven't had a chance yet to check it out, I urge you to do so.

Talk about everything they covered in Euler paper: ability to walk away from previous differential equation constraints, belief that Langevin's was great to initially approximate diffusion but led to multiple constraints, every facet of additive noise and denoising process, different formulas, ancestral sampling by stochastic addition of noise, Heun's sampling believed to best approximate gradient, modular design and separability of model components, 
Talk about avoiding connection directly between noisy input to network and direct output from denoised image to final network layer. Backbone of LDMs! Instead have VAE overarching with diffusion model in the middle.
