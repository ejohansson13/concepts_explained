# Schedulers

This page is intended to cover schedulers and the more popular scheduling algorithms utilized with Stable Diffusion models. These schedulers are  mathematical equations for the reverse diffusion process and adapted to neural network architectures for the purpose of image generation. This is intended to be a summary overview, and will focus on broad comparison between the research papers inspiring these algorithms. There are many more schedulers than those covered here. This page will abstract rigorous mathematical concepts and attempt to summarize each paper's contribution to the advancement of diffusion models.

All quotes, ideas, and images from the summarization of each research paper are taken from the accompanying paper unless cited otherwise.

## Background

## DDPM

Signal rescaling.

The first of a generation of research papers re-examining diffusion models for image synthesis, [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) proposed that diffusion models were capable of synthesizing high-quality images and bridged [noise conditional score networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05600) during training with annealed Langevin dynamics while sampling. Following the [2015 Sohl-Dickstein et. al paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03585), diffusion models were Markov chains parameterized with Gaussian noise and trained to reverse the diffusion process to generate samples matching their training data. Sohl-Dickstein proved that, given small additions of Gaussian noise along the Markov chain, both the forward and reverse processes would express valid samples from the same underlying distribution.

The forward process of adding noise to an image was dependent on a predetermined, linear schedule of variances. Adhering to Markov chain principles, each state was solely dependent on the previous state. A benefit of expressing the forward process as a schedule of variances was its sampling ability of any arbitrary latent variable along the chain. Changing the notation of the forward variance and taking the cumulative product of the rewritten variance allowed succinct expression of any state of x dependent only on the initial state. This removed the sequential restrictions of a Markov chain in the forward process. This equation can be seen below. Mention alpha = 1-beta, alpha_bar = cumpord(alpha) and beta is forward process variance.

The negative log likelihood of the reverse process (removing noise to arrive at a clean signal) could be optimized to arrive at an objective function comparing Gaussians via KL divergence. This simplified objective function was then optimizable via MSE and easily compatible with neural network architectures. The rewritten likelihood can be seen below.

The forward process variances could either be learned through reparameterization or treated as hyperparameters. The authors elected to treat them as hyperparameters, fixing them to constant values, and allowing the  L<sub>T</sub> term to be treated as a constant. Determining the  L<sub>t-1</sub> term determined the relationship between the forward noising process and reverse generative process. Determining the reverse generative process then became dependent on learning its mean and variance. The authors opted to tie the reverse process variance to the forward process variance. This could be implemented by rewriting the reverse process variance as a standard deviation constant multiplied by the identity matrix, where the standard deviation at every timestep was the square root of the forward process variance. Include equation below. This was also optimal for x0 sampled from normal distribution with 0 mean and identity variance.

After determining that the L<sub>t-1</sub> term depended on the mean and variance of the denoising process, and accounting for the variance, the authors rewrote the L<sub>t-1</sub> term[Eq. 8]. The rewritten loss served to minimize the distance between the reverse process mean approximator and the forward process posterior mean. This could then be reparameterized such that the reverse process mean function approximator was solely responsible for predicting the added noise to the original image[Eq. 12]. The authors noted that the approximator could also predict the original image, but in their research, this led to lower-quality results. The parameterization of the function approximator to predicting added noise bore similarities to both Langevin dynamics and [denoising score-matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05600).

The L<sub>0</sub> term could then be modeled using a separate, discrete decoder, although the authors left open the possibility that a more powerful, autoregressive decoder could also be employed. Having defined the reverse process and its final step decoder, the authors tweaked the final loss term, removing the weighting coefficient [Eq. 14], finding it improved sample quality and was easier to implement for model training. Additionally, the weighting coefficient from Eq. 12 down-weighted early steps in the Markov Chain, which was effectively implemented in the linear schedule of the forward process variance.

Supplementary conclusions from the paper determined that minimizing the early steps of the denoising process led to increased sample quality, likely as a result of allowing the model to focus on the more difficult denoising tasks. Researchers selected a U-Net architecture to model their training objective and observed its success at inference time despite non-competitive lossless codelengths, affirming the U-Net’s superior performance with spatial data. Other experimental details were maintained in later literature: temporal information was embedded into the U-Net, parameters were shared across timesteps, and each forward process in the noising process scaled down the signal input to prevent exploding variances across the chain. It also served to provide consistently scaled inputs to every subsequent latent in the trajectory. Similar to [previous](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03585) [literature](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05600), 1000 steps at inference time were taken to gauge sample quality. This also served as a baseline for future diffusion research. Researchers also examined the rate-distortion tradeoff of devoting bits to model images and found that a majority of bits were devoted to modeling imperceptible image details. This conclusion was a consistent issue in pixel-space diffusion and was the underlying theory behind [Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752) and their decision to first encode images prior to learning their conceptual composition. The original graph can be seen below.

DDPMs were the first step taken to revisit diffusion theory for image generation and, contemporarily, performed competitively in many image quality metrics. They were reliant on an unconditional model architecture with a wholly stochastic generative process, thanks to the introduction of an additional noise component in the generative process. Image generation and training was also prohibitively expensive due to pixel-space interpolations, with training on the CIFAR-10 dataset requiring the equivalent of 84.8 hours on a V100 GPU. DDPMs served as an important step forward in the utilization of diffusion theory for deep generative models, where they quickly demonstrated impressive capacity along a variety of applications. 

### Conclusion

## iDDPM

Following the success of the [DDPM paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239), researchers attempted to improve on the primary weaknesses through a variety of approaches. One approach, [Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09672), or iDDPMs, focused on the underperforming log-likelihood of the DDPM compared to other generative models. [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661) had demonstrated satisfactory performance at a variety of image generation metrics, but struggled to capture broad data distributions. [Razavi et. al in 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00446) argued that optimizing the log-likelihood for generative models pushed those models to capture all of the modes of the data distribution. iDDPM focused on improving the performance of diffusion models in log-likelihood along with other proposed improvements to the sampling processes. 

The authors began by retracing the derivation that led to the initial DDPM loss function. [Ho et. al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239) reweighted the variational-lower bound loss to achieve their L<sub>simple</sub> function. Ho et. al argued that the simplified loss function generated better sample quality than training on L<sub>VLB</sub> directly and tied the empirical results to an intuitive resemblance to relevant 2019 literature by [Song and Ermon](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05600). The DDPM L<sub>simple</sub> function had no input for the generative variance as they concluded image quality was far more dependent on the mean of the generative process. The authors of iDDPM agreed, but argued that similar image quality could be achieved with improved log-likelihood if a better method for determining the generative process variance was discovered. The revised generative variance would have to be achieved while avoiding the training instability and inferior sample quality encountered in the original DDPM paper. The iDDPM authors elected to reparameterize the generative variance as an interpolation between the timestep-dependent noise variance and the cumulative product of the forward noising variances. The equation is given below.

<p align="center" width="100%">
  <img src="/Stable Diffusion/Images/Schedulers_Images/iddpm_generative_variance.png" width="60%">
</p>

The interpolation was dependent on an introduced vector v, containing one element per dimension and log-linear. The newly reparameterized generative variance was ineffective without the model learning its optimization. This required a new loss function denoted as the L<sub>VLB</sub> term. L<sub>VLB</sub> was solely responsible for guiding the generative process variance and was set a small coefficient (0.001) to prevent it from overwhelming the L<sub>simple</sub> term. The linear combination of the L<sub>simple</sub> and L<sub>VLB</sub> terms was designated L<sub>HYBRID</sub>.

Initially, authors expected optimizing L<sub>VLB</sub> directly would result in the optimal log-likelihood. Instead, the noisy gradients of L<sub>VLB</sub> were detrimental to the training process. Mitigating the noisy gradients, the authors employed importance sampling which significantly smoothed out the direct optimization of L<sub>VLB</sub> but was unhelpful in optimizing L<sub>HYBRID</sub>.

Another improvement the authors proposed was altering the noise schedule. The linear noise schedule from the original DDPM paper demonstrated sufficient functionality with high-resolution images, but struggled with lower resolution images. The authors determined the end of the linear schedule was too noisy with the model learning little from a borderline isotropic distribution. Instead the authors constructed a cosine schedule, clipping the maximum value to 0.999 and adding an offset of 0.008 to prevent abrupt changes in the noise level at the start or end of the process. The primary motivation for the new schedule was combatting the acceleration of additive noise at the end of the noising schedule. Employing a cosine schedule mitigated this issue while maintaining a near linear drop-off in the middle of the noising schedule. The cosine noise schedule resolved the marked fluctuations in noise level at the start and end of the noising process, but was ultimately an arbitrary decision. The authors noted that other mathematical functions with offsets at the start and end of the process would likely perform similarly.

After implementing the above changes to the DDPM methodology, the authors measured their efforts. Training on  L<sub>HYBRID</sub> with a cosine noise schedule provided similar FID performance with improved performance in log-likelihood. Expanded optimization on the L<sub>VLB</sub> term resulted in further improvements to the log-likelihood but was detrimental to the FID performance. 

Next, the authors examined another flaw in the original DDPM paper: slow, sequential, sampling speed. Unable to combat the sequential nature of sampling, they analyzed other methods to accelerate the process. After training the model for many more steps than the original DDPM paper (4000 vs 1000) in an effort to improve the sampling quality, the authors noted that they were able to successfully generate high-quality images in as few as 50 steps. Reducing 4000 steps to 50 steps was implemented by using 50 evenly spaced steps along the chain from 1 to 4000. Sampling via this accelerated fashion comprehensively outperformed DDPM sampled with the same number of steps and was competitive with contemporary literature. 

The authors expanded the scope of their research paper and examined distribution coverage of diffusion models compared to GANs, how model performance would scale with compute, and the potential benefits of a stronger conditioning signal on diffusion, similar to [Chen et. al in 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00713). All of these topics were also covered in a [later paper by the same authors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05233) a few months later. 

### Conclusion

## DDIM

[Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502) were directly inspired by [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models(DDPMs)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239). DDIMs focused on combating one of the primary weaknesses of DDPMs. While [Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (iDDPMs)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09672) improved the log-likelihood of diffusion models (among other contributions), DDIMs intended to improve the sampling speed of diffusion models without sacrificing sample quality (among other contributions). 

The key purpose of diffusion models is constructing a generative process to approximate the reverse denoising process of noised images. The denoising process is a reversal of the forward noising process. Therefore, there is an inherent relationship between the generative process and the forward noising process. To improve the speed of the generative process, the authors examined changes to the iterative noising process. They observed that the DDPM learning objective was solely dependent on the marginal distribution of the initial, clean image and its final, noisy latent. The objective was not dependent on the joint probability distribution of the sequential latents necessary to transition from one end point to the other. Researchers noted that many joint distributions exist with equivalent marginal distributions, expanding possible noising processes beyond Markovian ones, while maintaining the DDPM learning objective.

Researchers indexed the new family of noising distributions by a vector 𝝈, with the vector controlling the stochasticity of the noising process. They proved that, for a certain 𝝈, the forward noising process became Markovian and the corresponding generative process would be a DDPM. Any other value of 𝝈 would create a non-Markovian forward noising process, with latent states depending on both their previous state and the original state. Reversing the noising process allowed for a defined denoising process dependent on the vector 𝝈. Any latent variable x<sub>t-1</sub> would be dependent on both the initial variable x<sub>0</sub> and x<sub>t</sub>. This would create the framework for training the generative process. The generative training process added noise to an initial clean image x<sub>0</sub>, achieving x<sub>t</sub>. The model would estimate the added noise and remove it from x<sub>t</sub> to achieve a predicted x<sub>0</sub>. Given the two dependencies x<sub>0</sub> and x<sub>t</sub>, the model could employ the defined denoising distribution to predict the denoised state x<sub>t-1</sub>. This iterative process was necessary for inference, where the model would only be given a noisy latent and need to progressively denoise it to arrive at a clean and coherent image.

Alternatively, assigning 𝝈 to zero, the authors arrived at an entirely deterministic process. With 𝝈 determining the stochasticity of the noising process, setting 𝝈 to zero achieved deterministic control. Describing the generative instance as a Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model, the authors related their discovery to [Mohamed and Lakshminarayanan’s](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03483) definition of an implicit probabilistic model. Rather than approximating the data distribution with a likelihood function, implicit probabilistic models generate samples from the underlying data distribution through a defined stochastic process. The generated images of DDIMs are inextricably tied to their initial latent variable. This property also guarantees that for an observed x<sub>0</sub> and x<sub>t</sub> (where x<sub>t</sub> is easily achievable, given x<sub>0</sub>), x<sub>t-1</sub> becomes known and fixed, exemplifying the consistency of the DDIM sampling process.

The deterministic property of DDIMs guarantees that the same initial latent will always map to the same destination image, given the same number of parameters and steps taken. This was not possible with DDPMs, due to the stochasticity in the forward noising process and reverse denoising process. Varying the number of steps for a DDIM will result in images sharing a large number of high-level features, e.g. yellow-and-black birds with differing patterns or beak shapes. The consistency of DDIMs allowed for latent encodings along the generative process, applicable for a variety of downstream tasks. The authors examined latent variable interpolation to alter the high-level features of images and drive them towards semantically meaningful combinations of specific concepts.

Model training for any generative process could be optimized via the variational objective J<sub>𝝈</sub>. It could appear the variational objective would require retraining different models for any and all 𝝈. However, the authors proved a linear relationship between J<sub>𝝈</sub> and the DDPM objective. This allowed a model trained with the DDPM objective to be functionally compatible with the 𝝈-dependent generalization of the new family of generative processes and vice versa. Similar to iDDPM, the authors recognized that this algorithmic compatibility with differing training structures allowed for a model to be trained with a greater number of forward steps (in the hopes of better understanding image compositions), while only sampling from a subset of them. The authors suggested this theory, but left empirical examinations to future work. The cross-algorithmic compatibility of these processes allowed for models to be trained once with the DDPM variational objective in the forward process and utilize any other 𝝈-dependent generative process for sampling. This was one of the first steps towards incorporating different sampling algorithms for the same model architecture, a critical concept for [Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752).

Training with an arbitrary number of forward steps, while only sampling from a subset, also allowed for accelerated sampling schedules. Since the denoising objective was not dependent on any specific forward noising process, noising processes with compressed schedules could be considered, allowing the utilization of their correspondingly compressed generative processes. This allowed for far fewer timesteps needed at sampling time compared to those taken in training. Researchers considered shortening schedules in both linear and quadratic fashions, with both methods demonstrating capable performance with different datasets. The authors demonstrated that DDIMs emphatically outperformed DDPMs with the shortened sampling schedule, achieving comparable image quality 10x or 50x faster than DDPMs. For three of the four datasets researchers examined, DDIMs outperformed DDPMs given 10, 20, 50, and 100 iterations. In the final dataset, DDIMs outperformed DDPMs at 10, 20, and 50 steps, with worse performance at 100 steps.

Researchers’ theoretical derivation of the variational objective lifted diffusion sampling from the restrictions of Langevin dynamics. Langevin dynamics translates a continuous gradient flow to a discrete procedure, but requires many iterations to achieve a high-quality approximation. This theoretical requisite intrinsically limits the ability of DDPMs to generate high-quality images in few iterations. In contrast, DDIMs coherently and deterministically map isotropic noise back to the original image. This mapping and its accompanying consistency property allow for an accelerated sampling schedule to accomplish the majority of the high-level features of the image in far fewer iterations, ceding a legitimate tradeoff between sampling speed and image quality.

After achieving a formula for predicting the iteratively denoised latent state, the authors rewrote the equation, and reparameterized key variables to express an equation similar to the Euler solver of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). The authors noted the similarities between their reparameterization and [Song et. al’s 2020 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13456) examining probability flow ODEs. Despite the equivalency of the ODEs, their respective sampling procedures differed, with the differences emphasized when fewer sampling steps were taken. However, the authors’ perspective shift in examining diffusion as an ODE problem set the stage for [future literature](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00364).

## EDM

If DDIMs laxly negotiated the loosening of constraints accompanying the DDPM theory, [Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364?ref=blog.segmind.com) arrived with a bang and a demand for further liberation from said constraints. The first sentence announced the authors' intent: "We argue that the theory and practice of diffusion-based generative models are currently unnecessarily convoluted and seek to remedy the situation by presenting a design space that clearly separates the concrete design choices". They succeeded. Over a third of the schedulers currently available (as of January 2024) on Hugging Face for Stable Diffusion implementation owe their theoretical background to this literature[2]. If you're looking for another perspective on this paper in particular, which influenced so many scheduling algorithms I highly recommend you check out this [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0Qxzf0eaio) which offers a digestible and intuitive understanding.

This paper begins by examining the theoretical backing of diffusion-based image generation models. The authors observe that, in an eagerness for solid theoretical footing, many researchers restricted the design space for image synthesis models to ideas running in parallel to established mathematical theory. Following similar literature, the authors begin by utilizing an [ordinary differential equation (ODE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation) to describe the probability flow modeling the denoising process. The authors argue that most papers employ Euler's method, but that a higher-order solver actually leads to an increase in compute efficiency. Solving an ODE numerically inherently involves an approximation of the true solution. At each step, approximating the solution trajectory introduces truncation error, scaling superlinearly as a function of the step size. Taking smaller steps leads to a more accurate approximation, at the expense of calls to the denoising neural network. Researchers observed that these calls to the denoiser bore the greatest correlation to both time and compute resources in arriving at a denoised image. They propose a parametrization allowing for smaller steps along the trajectory approaching the denoised image, while taking larger steps at the onset of the denoising process.

The authors also argue that selecting a solver is often over-valued. Many components of image synthesis models (network architecture, training details, sampler algorithms) previously thought to be highly dependent on one another are modular, and theoretical constraints placed on sampling algorithms to align with the overall model can be loosened. To prove this, they plug-and-play their higher-order sampler with parametrized time-discretization steps into previous model architectures and compare against both the model baselines and another plug-and-play configuration with a scheduling and scaling approach equivalent to that taken in DDIMs. Lower [Frechet Inception Distance (FID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_inception_distance) scores were reached with a plug-and-play approach, not requiring the networks' retraining and supporting the modularity of image synthesis models.

Generalized ODE allows for directly specifying any sigma(t).

Next, the authors turned to the role of stochasticity in latent variable denoising. Ostensibly, ODEs and [stochastic differential equations (SDEs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation) cover the same trajectory, but a stochastic approach to denoising introduces new noise at every timestep it removes noise. This stochastic behavior might nudge a generated image to better approximate the denoising trajectory, or it might wander from the optimal trajectory and lead to a lower-quality image. This examination of stochastic behavior and its working in concert with ODE solutions was the guiding intuition behind ancestral schedulers for Stable Diffusion models. Ancestral schedulers balance the navigation of the solution trajectory with forays into alternative branches of the image denoising probability distribution. They walk away from the purely deterministic approach of ODEs, and often generate new and unexplored image generation possibilities from the same latent noise selection.
