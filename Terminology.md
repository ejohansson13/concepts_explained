# Acronyms

AI - Artifical Intelligence; abstract concept of non-organic intelligence capable of performing intelligently

ML - Machine Learning; broad field focused on the relationship between a program's experience with a task and its performance at that task, "a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E" - Tom Mitchell

# Definitions

Computer Vision - comprehension or analysis of a program in response to visual stimulus; includes image classification, image detection, image segmentation, and other areas of machine learning or artificial intelligence related to the understanding of information presented in a visible medium

Image Classification - successful categorization of relevant objects in an image

Image Detection - location and identification of relevant objects in an image

Image Generation - formation of a visually coherent image from previous incoherent noise

Image Segmentation - isolation and partition of relevant objects in an image; often accompanied by a box demonstrating the boundaries of the specified object

Image Synthesis - see Image Generation

Natural Language Processing - comprehension or analysis of a program in response to information presented in a texual medium; includes sentiment analysis, text generation, text summarization, and other areas of machine learning or artificial intelligence related to the understanding of text
